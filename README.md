# Shapes-Learning-App-for-Kids
Designed and developed an interactive educational app using Flutter, targeted at children aged 5â€“13, to help them learn and identify geometric shapes. The app categorizes shapes into 3-sided (triangles), 4-sided (quadrilaterals), and 5+ sided (polygons). Each shape is accompanied by an image and a kid-friendly description.
